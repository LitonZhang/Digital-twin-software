# A-digital-twin-software-for-discrete-manufacturing-system-IMDT
This repository contains the core code implementation for the paper: **"The Construction Method and Control Strategy of Digital Twin Software for Discrete Manufacturing Shop Floor."** The code is designed to facilitate the development of digital twin systems in discrete manufacturing environments.
﻿
## Key Features
﻿
The repository includes implementations for key functionalities of the prototype digital twin software named **Intelligent Manufacturing Digital Twin (IMDT)**:
﻿
- **OPC UA Communication:** Efficient data exchange between devices and systems.
- **Socket Communication:** Real-time communication for enhanced interactivity.
- **Manufacturing Finite State Machine (MFSM):** A structured approach to model manufacturing processes.
- **Event Classification Parallel Simulation Algorithm (ECPA):** An algorithm for classifying events in parallel simulations.
-**Monitor Alogorithm**
﻿
## Development Environment
﻿
IMDT is developed in a Windows environment using **Unity3D 2021.3.26f1c1**.
