# A-digital-twin-software-for-discrete-manufacturing-system-IMDT
This repository contains the core code implementation for the paper: "The Construction Method and Control Strategy of Digital Twin Software for Discrete Manufacturing Shop floor". The code is designed to facilitate the development of digital twin systems in discrete manufacturing environments. It includes implementations for key functionalities of a prototype of the digital twin software named intelligent manufacturing digital twin (IMDT), such as OPC UA communication, socket communication, finite state machine (MFSM) modeling for manufacturing processes, and a  event classification parallel simulation algorithm (ECPA). IMDT is an integrated system developed in a Windows environment using Unity3D 2021.3.26f1c1.
The code is coming soon.
